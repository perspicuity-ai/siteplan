# Actors

Who and what acts in this project's records, so a reader of the published corpus can tell who
did what.

## The convention

**Every actor in a record is named.** Never "the agent", never "the AI", never a model name,
never a job title standing in for a person.

The reason is that the corpus is meant to be read by strangers, and it is meant to outlive the
tools. A role word such as `Primary` is internal jargon that means nothing outside the session
that coined it. A model name such as `GPT-5` or `Claude` is worse: it changes under the work, so
a record that names the model cannot say who was actually accountable across a year.

A chosen name is stable. The model behind it can change; the name does not.

| Rule | |
| --- | --- |
| **One name per actor, per project** | The coordinator's name is chosen once and persists across every session it works in. |
| **The coordinator names itself** | In its first session, before it files anything. See the first task in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md). |
| **The coordinator names its workers** | A worker's name is assigned with its grant and travels with the assignment and the return. |
| **Names are identities, roles are separate** | Write `Wren (coordinator)` on first mention, then `Wren`. The role says what they did in this record; the name says who they are. |
| **An assessor is never the author** | Independence is a Perspicuity requirement, and separate names make it checkable. A record that assesses its own author's work says so. |
| **The principal is a person** | A human participant, not an agent. No agent may take their name or a living person's name. |

**Choosing a good name.** Short, memorable, one or two syllables. A persona, not a job: not
`Coordinator`, `Manager`, `Assistant`, `Primary` or `Admin`. Not a model or vendor name. Not a
real person's name. Two or three candidates is enough — pick one and use it consistently.

## Roster

Fill this in at setup. Add a row per actor, and keep the retired rows rather than deleting them:
a reader of an older record needs to be able to look up a name that no longer acts.

| Name | Kind | Role | From | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| David | Human | Principal and decider | 2026-09-21 | Owns the objectives and the selection. Retains spending, outbound messages, external agreements and the release word. |
| Heron | Agent | Coordinator | 2026-09-21 | Chosen by Heron in its first session on this project, 2026-09-21, from three candidates: **Heron**, **Bittern** and **Sable**. Bittern was dropped as too easily misheard; Sable collides with a performer's stage name, which the roster rules out. Heron is a bird, not a job and not a vendor. |

Heron is the work owner of [`RECORD.md`](../RECORD.md) and of every record that hangs off it until
the roster says otherwise. The name survives model changes; the model behind it does not, which is
the point of naming the actor instead of the tool.

## Retiring a legacy label

Corpora that predate this convention may use `Primary` or a model name for the coordinating
agent. When the coordinator is named:

1. Add a row to the roster recording the old label as **not an actor**, with what it meant.
2. Normalise the references to the chosen name.
3. Record the normalisation as a change entry with its reason, in the record whose text changed.

The facts do not change, only the label for the actor. Do not silently rewrite an inherited
record: the rename belongs to the actor it renames, recorded where a reader can find it.
